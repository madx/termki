= TermKi

TermKi is a full text wiki, with a REST oriented approach. There is no fancy Web
front-end, and you interact with bare HTTP requests using curl, Patron, 
RestClient or other librairies.

TermKi is very basic: you have an index of pages, which can have many revisions.
That's all.

== Usage

To run termki, just edit the termki.ru file to suit your needs (defaults are
fine though) and run
  $ rackup termki.ru

This will run the Ruby server, and make it accessible at localhost:9292

There is a default home page which can't be removed, you can access it at
  http://localhost:9292/

== Routes

get /__commit__    commit changes to the store
get /__index__     show the page index
get /              == get /home
get /:page         show the page
get /:page/:rev    show a given revision for a page
post /:page        creates a page (give contents=<contents> as parameter)
put /:page         creates a new revision for a page (same as above)
delete /:page      deletes a page (except /home)
delete /:page/:rev deletes a given revision, and the page if there are no
                   remaining revisions (except for /home)

== Persistence

TermKi uses a single file for storing data. Data is stored each time you access
/__commit__. The format is simple, it's the Wiki object marshalled and zipped in
a file.
