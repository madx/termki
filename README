= TermKi

TermKi is a full text wiki, with a REST oriented approach. There is no fancy Web
front-end, and you interact with bare HTTP requests using curl, RestClient or
other librairies.

== Usage

To run termki, just edit the termki.ru file to suit your needs (defaults are
fine though) and run

  $ rackup termki.ru

This will run the Ruby server, and make it accessible at localhost:9292

There is a default home page which can't be removed, you can access it at
http://localhost:9292/.
